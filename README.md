# Flask v2.0 application w/ Caddy v2.0 reverse proxy

application behind a Caddy v2.0 reverse proxy. 

Caddy is great because:

- automatic HTTPS 
- performant in containers because it has no dependencies, not even libc
- easy configuration

## Usage

First, spin up the Flask app and Caddy:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Next, point your browser to

<https://flask.localhost>
